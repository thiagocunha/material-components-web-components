      <p>
        If you don't have actions, you may want to set the "hideActions" property.
        This property will remove extra whitespace at the bottom of this dialog.
        This button will toggle that whitespace:

        This is what happens when you set the stacked property on mwc-dialog.
        Notice that the primary action is now on top.

        In this example we set "dialogInitialFocus" on the mwc-textfield.
